# 🧠 PostureSense (Demo Version)

> **PostureSense** is an ultra-lightweight, real-time posture & activity detection API, optimized for microcontrollers and edge devices like ESP32 and Raspberry Pi.  
> This public version includes a **demo simulation** of posture output — the full classification logic is private for security, licensing, and IP protection.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**PostureSense** brings intelligent posture monitoring to embedded systems without relying on cloud or heavy compute. Built with TinyML principles, it enables developers and hardware startups to integrate real-time posture detection into:

- 🎓 Smart Classrooms
- 🪑 Posture-aware Furniture
- 👴 Elderly Movement Monitoring
- 🧑‍💻 Developer Wellness Tools

## 📦 Output Example

This demo simulates real-time posture data as if it were running on a live camera + classifier setup:

```json
{
  "posture": "slouch",
  "attention": false,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "note": "Simulated output. Contact for full access."
}



🧪 Demo Instructions
▶️ Run Locally
bash

git clone https://github.com/GeekAvi007/PostureSence-MCU-API
cd posturesense-demo
pip install -r requirements.txt
python api/server.py
Visit: http://127.0.0.1:5000/posture
You'll receive simulated JSON output mimicking posture predictions.

📚 Use Cases
🪑 Smart Chair
Triggers buzzer or LED if poor posture is detected for more than 3 minutes.

🎓 Student Focus API
Flags inattentiveness in live online classrooms and sends alerts to dashboards.

👴 Elderly Monitor
Detects slouching or unusual head positions and alerts caregivers locally.

🧑‍💻 DevPosture Tracker
Rates your coding posture over time and shows analytics in a dashboard.
