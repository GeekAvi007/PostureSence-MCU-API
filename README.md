# 🧠 PostureSense (Demo Version)

> **PostureSense** is an ultra-lightweight, real-time posture & activity detection API, optimized for microcontrollers and edge devices like ESP32 and Raspberry Pi.  
> This public version includes a **demo simulation** of posture output — the full classification logic is private for security, licensing, and IP protection.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**PostureSense** brings intelligent posture monitoring to embedded systems without relying on the cloud or high-performance GPUs. Designed for real-time, offline use, it's perfect for integrating into smart chairs, classrooms, and wellness devices.

Built with **TinyML** and **Edge AI**, PostureSense transforms posture monitoring from bulky models to minimal, firmware-friendly APIs — designed for real-world deployment.

## 🧪 Demo Instructions

### ▶️ Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GeekAvi007/PostureSence-MCU-API
cd posturesense-demo
pip install -r requirements.txt
python api/server.py
Visit: http://127.0.0.1:5000/posture
You'll receive simulated JSON output mimicking posture predictions.

📚 Use Cases
🪑 Smart Chair
Triggers buzzer or LED if poor posture is detected for more than 3 minutes.

🎓 Student Focus API
Flags inattentiveness in live online classrooms and sends alerts to dashboards.

👴 Elderly Monitor
Detects slouching or unusual head positions and alerts caregivers locally.

🧑‍💻 DevPosture Tracker
Rates your coding posture over time and shows analytics in a dashboard.

🧠 Why It’s Different
🧩 Built for Edge, Not the Cloud
Most AI APIs require internet, servers, or cloud inferencing. PostureSense is optimized for offline usage on microcontrollers — from Raspberry Pi Zero to ESP32-CAM.

📦 You Built an API, Not Just a Model
This isn't just ML — it's a modular developer-ready API designed with:

Licensing potential

Real-world device integration

SDK & dashboard bundling

🔬 TinyML + Embedded Deployment = Rare Combo
Very few developers specialize in:

TinyML optimization

Real-time posture/gesture AI

Deployable edge APIs for hardware startups

You're building what < 0.01% of devs even attempt.
